Markdown-generated website
==========================

Generates a markdown-based website, using [Silex micro-framework][s] & your own [markdown][m] files.


A markdown-based website, the easy way
--------------------------------------

*Markdown* files use the [markdown syntax][m], a very easy way to add typographical enhancements in your texts.
All markdown files in the `./resource` directory are displayed as links in the navigation bar above
(all demo files texts come from [Cupcake Ipsum][c]).

[Markdown philosophy reminder](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy): "A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions."

Anyway, you can mix html, inline-css (even if it's bad) & markdown between html tags, using a `markdon="1"` html attribute (see [muffin.md][4] page in this demo).

The website uses the lastest version of [Twitter Bootrap][b].

The `/resources` directory contains various markdown files, prefixed with a ordered number:

* [0-README.md][0] - the file your are just reading
* [1-Cupcake.md][1]
* [2-Cheesecake.md][2]
* [3-Gingerbread.md][3]
* [4-Muffin.md][4]
* [5-Tiramisu.md][5]

etc.

Just start creating your own markdown files in the `./resources` directory, and your website is up.
